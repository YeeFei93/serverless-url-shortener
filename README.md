## Features

### Core Functionality
- Static web UI hosted on S3 + CloudFront (`https://ui.sctp-sandbox.com`)
- Short links powered by API Gateway + Lambda (`https://short.sctp-sandbox.com`)
- Auto-generated 8-character short codes using UUID
- Serverless and scalable architecture
- Infrastructure as Code provisioning with Terraform
- CORS support with dedicated OPTIONS Lambda
- Custom domains with SSL certificates via AWS Certificate Manager

- Alerting with anomaly detection
- Cost tracking and optimization insights
- Custom log analysis and performance monitoring

---

## Automated Deployment

### GitHub Actions

Set up automated daily deployment using GitHub Actions:

1. **Quick Setup**: Run the setup script
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup-aws-for-github-actions.sh
   ./setup-aws-for-github-actions.sh
   ```

**Features:**
- Daily automatic deployment at 8:00 AM Singapore Time (SGT)
- Manual trigger with optional resource cleanup
- Health checks and deployment status notifications  
- AWS access key authentication
- Terraform remote state management
- Monitoring and alerting

### Manual Deployment

## Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Terraform installed (v1.0+)
- Access to a Route 53 hosted zone for `sctp-sandbox.com`

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YeeFei93/serverless-url-shortener.git
cd serverless-url-shortener
```

### 2. Build Lambda Deployment Packages

```bash
./build.sh
```

This script creates the necessary ZIP files for Lambda deployment:
- `lambda/shorten.zip` - URL shortening functionality
- `lambda/redirect.zip` - URL redirection functionality  
- `lambda/options.zip` - CORS preflight handling

### 3. Deploy Infrastructure

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

**What happens during deployment:**
- **`providers.tf`** configures AWS provider and retrieves Route 53/IAM data
- **`database.tf`** creates DynamoDB table with proper configuration
- **`iam.tf`** attaches necessary policies to Lambda execution role
- **`lambda.tf`** deploys all three Lambda functions (shorten, redirect, options)
- **`api-gateway.tf`** sets up HTTP API with routes and integrations
- **`dns.tf`** provisions SSL certificates and configures DNS records
- **`frontend.tf`** creates S3 bucket, uploads files, and sets up CloudFront
- **`monitoring.tf`** deploys CloudWatch dashboards, alarms, and log groups
- **`security.tf`** configures WAF protection and enhanced security policies

The organized file structure makes it easy to understand and troubleshoot each deployment phase.

**Note:** The infrastructure is already deployed. SSL certificates are automatically provisioned and validated via Route 53.

### 4. Frontend Deployment (Automated)

The frontend `index.html` is automatically uploaded to S3 via Terraform and served through CloudFront.

## API Endpoints

### POST `/shorten`

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://short.sctp-sandbox.com/shorten \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \

```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "short_url": "https://short.sctp-sandbox.com/abc12345"
}
```

---

### GET `/{short_id}`

Redirects to the original URL.

```bash
curl -I https://short.sctp-sandbox.com/abc12345
```

**Response:**
```
HTTP/2 302
Location: https://www.example.com
```
